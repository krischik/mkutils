[MKUtils](http://www.jpsoftwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=MkUtils_%28plugin%29) is currently under development. Once it is finished it will be a Plug-in for 4NT and Take Command.

Currently a port of the [demo plugin to Ada](http://www.jpsoftwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Ada_Demo_%28plugin%29) is available. It is perfect if you want to learn how to develop plug-ins for 4NT or Take Command.

Under development is a ACL (access control list) support and a trace feature.

Unlike other 4NT and Take Command this Plug-in is open source so you can have a look how it is done. You can also ask to join the project if you have ideas of your own.
